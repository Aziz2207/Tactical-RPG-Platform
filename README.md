# Tactical-RPG-Platform-Project

Developed a minimalistic tactical RPG platform where players engage in grid-based gameplay featuring various
terrains, obstacles and turn-based combat. The project involved the following technologies :

-   Frontend : Used Angular with TypeScript to build a dynamic and responsive user interface.
-   Backend : Implemented server-side logic with Nest.js and to manage game mechanics and player interactions.
-   Database : Integrated MongoDB to handle data storage for player stats, maps and game states.
-   Features : Included map navigation, turn-based combat, interactive elements and a game editor for creating
    new games and scenarios.
-   Testing : Conducted client-side testing using Jasmine to ensure component functionality, and performed server-
    side testing with Jest to validate API endpoints and core game logic.
