# 🎮 Tactical RPG Platform — Multiplayer Game System

Tactical RPG Platform is a **cross-platform multiplayer RPG system** developed as part of the **LOG3900 academic project**.

The product consists of:
- a **desktop client** (Electron),
- a **tablet mobile client** (Flutter),
- and a **shared backend server** supporting real-time interactions.

The project focuses on **client–server architecture**, **real-time communication**, and **scalable system design**, following industry-inspired software engineering practices.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

The platform includes multiple gameplay and social features commonly found in online games, such as:
- user accounts and authentication,
- real-time chat and communication channels,
- channel and member management,
- in-game social interactions.

Both clients communicate with a **centralized backend**, ensuring consistency and synchronization across platforms.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend**
  - Desktop client built with **Electron + Angular**
  - Tablet mobile client built with **Flutter (Dart)**
- **Backend**
  - **NestJS (TypeScript)** server
  - REST APIs and real-time client–server interactions
- **Data & Services**
  - **MongoDB** for persistence
  - **Firebase** for account and authentication management
- **Infrastructure**
  - Deployed on **AWS**
  - CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and validation

---

## ⚙️ Key Technical Features

- Real-time client–server communication (notifications, chat events)
- Channel creation, deletion, and member permission management
- Modular backend architecture inspired by **microservices principles**
- Clean separation between clients and server
- CI/CD integration for continuous validation
- UML diagrams and system design documentation

---

## 👨‍💻 Personal Contributions

My main responsibilities included:
- Development of the **desktop client (Electron)**, focusing on real-time features:
  - chat notifications,
  - channel management,
  - member access control,
  - message moderation and blocking.
- Full ownership of the **software architecture documentation**:
  - system design,
  - UML diagrams,
  - architectural decisions and trade-offs.
- Code reviews and **quality assurance** within the team.

---

## 👥 Team & Process

- Team of **6 developers**
- **Agile workflow** with:
  - 3 sprints (~1 month each)
  - sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives
- Version control and collaboration using **GitLab**
- Strong emphasis on communication and collaborative development

---

## 🎓 Academic Context

This project was developed as part of the **LOG3900 Software Engineering Project** course.

The goal was to simulate a **real-world software engineering environment**, including:
- teamwork,
- architecture design,
- documentation,
- quality assurance,
- and delivery constraints.
